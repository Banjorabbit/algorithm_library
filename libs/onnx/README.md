# ONNX Binaries and Libraries

This folder contains binaries and third-party libraries related to the Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) project. 

ONNX is an open-source project that enables models to be portable among various AI frameworks. This interoperability is achieved through the use of a common representation of the computation graph in models.

The binaries in this folder are executable files that have been compiled from the source code of the ONNX project, or are ONNX models themselves.

For more information about ONNX, please visit the [official ONNX website](https://onnx.ai/).

## ONNX models in this folder
- model.onnx - The simplest possible model that takes a 1x1x1 tensor as input and returns it as output. It is intended for tests where the processing doesn't matter.
